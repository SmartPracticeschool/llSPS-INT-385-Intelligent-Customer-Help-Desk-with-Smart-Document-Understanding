# llSPS-INT-385-Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding

Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding.This Internship program was develope under guidance of the Smartinternz.

This program was made by using IBM cloud services which includes Watson Assistance , Watson Discovery ,Function and a NodeRed .
I have used a standard customer care dialog to handle a typical conversation between a custmomer and a company and also I have use Watson Discovery model to get optmize aswers for the customer question,I have used a documnet for the better search and to obtain a better result and finally connect a function with a webhook and Watson discovery.When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.The webhook will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isnâ€™t valid or offer to speak to a real person.To take it a step further, we will use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
