This program was made using IBM cloud services which include Watson Assistance , Watson Discovery ,Function and a NodeRed .
I have used a standard customer care dialog to handle a typical conversation between a custmomer and a company and also I have use Watson Discovery model to get optmize aswers for the customer question,I have used a documnet for the better search and to obtain a better result and finally connect a function with a webhook and Watson discovery.When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.The webhook will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.
